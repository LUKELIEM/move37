# OpenAI's Vectorized Environments are a method for stacking multiple independent environments 
# into a single environment. Instead of training an RL agent on 1 environment per step, it allows 
# us to train it on n environments per step.

import numpy as np
from multiprocessing import Process, Pipe

# In multiprocessing, processes are spawned by creating a Process object and then calling start().

# multiprocessing supports two types of communication channel between processes:
#   Queue() - a near clone of queue.Queue
#   Pipe() - returns a pair of connection objects connected by a duplex (two-way) pipe.
#     Each connection object has send() and recv() methods (among others).

# OpenAI implements vectorized environs by pairing a parent to a worker using Pipe().

    # In this function, the worker receives a cmd from its parent on the other end of Pipe and
    # acts upon the cmd.
